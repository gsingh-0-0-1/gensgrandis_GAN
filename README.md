This is a repo dedicated to using Generative Adversarial Networks to generate simulated video game terrain - particularly for the game I'm developing, Gens Grandis (http://gensgrandis.com). I've adapted code from Tensorflow's DCGAN tutorial and the code that I used to generate handwritten digits from MNIST (which I have another repository for). I'm just fiddling around and testing different optimization parameters for now, but hopefully this can become a viable method of generating terrain.
